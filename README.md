# Cart-pole

Cart-pole systems are great benchmarks to study control strategies.
So in this repository, you can find nonlinear dynamics of the single inverted pendulum on a cart pole.
The double inverted pendulum on a cart pole is also added.
Due to the high nonlinear dynamics both system present, it is a great starting point to analyze
control strategies like PID, LQR, and more advanced control strategies like L1 Adaptive Control.

## Controllers

At the time of this writing, you can find:

- LQR Controllers
- L1 Adaptive Controllers

Both control streategies have been applied to both single and double inverted pendulum systems.
